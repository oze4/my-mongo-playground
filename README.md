My MongoDB Playground - built for randomness with Node and Mongo (mainly for testing when helping people on Stack Overflow)

If you have an Atlas instance (can get them for free!), you can use this code.  Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and change the values within it.

### Commands

 - `npm start`
   - Runs `node index.js`
